## Description 
This project created a website that utilizes OpenWeather API and moment.js to display current and forecasted weather conditions for a given city. This site stores the previous ten cities that were searched in a history that allows the user to customize their site and navigate to several favorite cities quickly. Page formatting was done using BootStrap.

## Installation 
There is no formal installation process for this application. To access the site the user just needs to head to https://jpolmon.github.io/WeatherHW06/.

<a id="usage"></a> 
## Usage 
Utilization of this app begins with the user entering a city name. If the city does not exist in the OpenWeather API the user will be prompted to try a different city name. Once the user successfully searches for a city it will be added to the history. Once the city is in the history bar the user can click on that city to pull up it's weather information.
